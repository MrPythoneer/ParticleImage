# ParticleImage
Draws images using particles in Minecraft 1.17

It actually **works really slow**, so you'll never consider to have this plugin on your server.

This project was for learning purposes. I'm just learning Java.

New commands:

    Adds image to the image array and returns the image position in the array
    /init_image url x y z [width height]

    Draws the image from the image array
    /draw_image imgID
    
    Deletes the image from the image array
    /delete_image imgID
    
    Clears the image array
    /delete_all
    
    Stops all images from drawing
    /stop_all
    
    And, yes, there's no command to stop one image from drawing. I'm too bored to do it.
